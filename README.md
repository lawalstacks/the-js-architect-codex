This repository is my **personal lab notebook** 🔬 and **proof-of-work** 🏗️ for the **“JavaScript: Cracked-As-F*ck” 💣** curriculum.
 
It documents my full journey — my `_path_` — from mastering the **Atoms ⚛️** of JavaScript to building a full **Vite ⚡-like ecosystem 🌐** from scratch 👽.
 
This isn’t just theory — it’s **Proof of Work 🏗️**. I didn’t just *learn* these concepts; I *built* the **Gauntlets 🏆**.
  
## 🗺️ Learning Path & Gauntlet Status
 
Each Part represents a mastery level. Each **Gauntlet 🏆** is a boss-level project series that fuses all concepts from that stage.

## 🧭 How to Follow the Journey
 
You can follow this learning odyssey in two ways:
 
 
1.  
**Read the Code 📜** Explore each `GAUNTLET_PROJECTS/` folder to see the working “Final Boss” code.
 
 
2.  
**Follow the Commits 💾** The repo follows the **Pro 👽 Commit Standard** — every commit captures thought process, iteration, and insights.
 
 

  
## 🧠 Philosophy
 
 
**Real learning = building.** Theory is ink. Code is proof. 💥
 
 
This codex is a living experiment — a demonstration that mastery is earned through creation, not consumption.
 
Walk through the parts. Face the bosses. Crack the code.
